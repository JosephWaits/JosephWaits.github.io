    <h2>Documented Inconvenient Discrepancies</h2>
	        
	        <ul>
	            <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> "Once you have completed all the required items for you web page, you should include the label<br>
	            <strong>8 Programming Portfolio Website Link.</strong>" Sound confusing? It is. It was later <br>
	                acknowledged that "8 Programming" was a typo.</li>
	            
	            <li><strong>Week 1: Javascripts</strong> directions are a bit ambiguous. First, it says add a descriptive<br>
	                paragraph. Then, it says leave it blank. Add a paragraph? Or leave it blank?</li>
	            
	            <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> On step 1, it says to do Khan and W3Cschool material. W3Cschools??? Where did that come from?<br>
	                And, what material are you talking about? Is there something I'm missing?</li>
	            
	            <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> This one might be the <em>most frustrating</em> of all. On the course materials page on Brightspace, there were<br>
	                various links for Pixlr tutorials, two of which were went nowhere. One kept arriving at YouTube saying "Private Video," and<br>
	                the other said, "YouTube refused to connect." What a waste of time.</li>
	                
	            <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Why is there a Step 3: Create a Web Server Account on Github Pages written? Shouldn't it be assumed that has<br>
	                already occurred? Clean up the instructions.</li>
	            
	            <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> On step 4, it goes on to mention Steps 2(a), (c), and (d). However, there are NO Steps 2(a), or (c), or (d) to<br>
	                be found. It's like my what my 9th grade English teacher said in regard to outlines: "You can't have an 'A' without a 'B.'<br>
	                You can't have a 1 without 2." To put this into Computer Science language, these are broken links.</li>
	        </ul>
