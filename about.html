        <p>Hello, my name is Joseph. Originally, I'm from South Carolina, but I've lived in Newport since 2007, <br> 
            no matter what the University of Rhode Island says.  I entered the semester as a Film major, but as the <br>
        existential dread of possibly graduating with out-of-state debt and a dubious Film degree hit me, I quickly looked <br>
        towards Computer Science. Now that I'm here, I'm freaking out even more.</p>
