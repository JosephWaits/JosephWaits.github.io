        <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
        
        <p>Hello, my name is Joseph. Originally, I'm from South Carolina, but I've lived in Newport since 2007, <br> 
            no matter what the University of Rhode Island tells you.  I entered the semester as a Film major, but as the <br>
        existential dread of possibly graduating with out-of-state debt and a dubious Film degree hit me, I quickly looked <br>
        towards Computer Science.</p>
        
        <p>But before I began this college mumbo jumbo, I had the privelege to sail all around the world, from South America to Antarctica, <br>
            and all points in between. I've trampled under foot all seven continents, but I believe my favorite memory was taking<br>
            the train across Russia. You should check it out.</p>
